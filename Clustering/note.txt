# model.inertia_ =represents the sum of squared distances between data points and their assigned cluster centroids. 
# This value is often used as a metric to evaluate the quality of the clustering.

# Agglomerative clustering = We're starting with all the values in our own clusters,
# And we're looking for the closest clusters.

#Unsupervised learning = given input data without any additional feedback, learn patterns.
#Clustering = Organizing a set of objects into groups in such a way that similar objects tend to be in the same group.
