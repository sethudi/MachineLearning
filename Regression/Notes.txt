# Regression = predicting dependent variables on the basis of independent variables.
# Linear Regression = Answers the question, how do we find the line of best fit for the data?

# R squared = A coefficient of determination, it's a measure of goodness and fit
# It tells you from a certain perspective how well the model you've built fits the thing you trying to predict

# confusion_matrix = in logistic regression, I could use it instead of R squared
